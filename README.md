# Discord Bot Template

A super simple discord bot template made using [JDA][1].

This template uses Gradle, and should be very simple to work with.

## Things you need to provide

Nothing! Well, other than a discord bot token.

## Building and Running

All you need to do is open a terminal, navigate to the top level folder of this project (`".../Discord Bot Template"`),
and run `gradlew clean build` to build the program. Then, you can run the build with
`gradlew run --args "your discord bot token here"`.

For more information on how to use JDA, [check out their github repository][1].
