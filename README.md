# Discord Bot Template

A super simple discord bot template made using [JDA][1].

This template uses Gradle, and should be very simple to work with.
All you need to do is open a terminal, navigate to the top level folder of this project (`".../Discord Bot Template"`),
and run `gradlew clean build` to build the program. Then, you can run the build with `gradlew run`. Happy developing!
